## üì° Solace Integration

S1GNAL.ZERO leverages Solace PubSub+ for:

* **Event-Driven Architecture**: All analysis requests flow through Solace topics
* **Guaranteed Delivery**: Persistent messaging ensures no analysis is lost
* **Agent Mesh**: Seamless communication between Java services and Python agents
* **Real-Time Updates**: Live streaming of analysis progress
* **Scalability**: Handle viral traffic spikes without infrastructure changes

### Topic Structure

    signalzero/analysis/request/{userId}/{analysisId}
    signalzero/agent/bot-detector/request
    signalzero/agent/bot-detector/response
    signalzero/agent/trend-analyzer/request
    signalzero/agent/trend-analyzer/response
    signalzero/updates/score/{analysisId}
    signalzero/usage/analysis/{userId}

## üí∞ Monetization Model

### Usage-Based Freemium Strategy

S1GNAL.ZERO implements a **usage-based freemium model** that balances public transparency with private insights:

#### Access Levels

**1. Public View (No Account)**

* **Full access** to system-wide dashboard showing real-time manipulation detection
* **View only** - cannot run personal analyses
* **Purpose**: Build trust and create urgency by showing live detection capabilities

**2. Authenticated Users (Account Required)**

* **Personal dashboard** with analysis history
* **Usage-based limits** enforced via Solace events
* **Automatic blocking** when monthly quota exceeded

### Subscription Tiers

| Tier | Price | Monthly Analyses | Features | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **PUBLIC** | Free | 0 (View Only) | Live dashboard, community feed | Awareness & lead generation |
| **FREE** | $0  | 3   | Basic Reality Score only | Trust building & proof of value |
| **PRO** | $99/mo | 100 | Detailed reports, API access, 90-day history | Individual power users |
| **BUSINESS** | $499/mo | 1,000 | Team seats (5+), priority queue, 1-year history | Marketing teams & agencies |
| **ENTERPRISE** | Custom | Unlimited | Dedicated Solace queue, SLA, white-label | Large organizations |

### How It Works

The system tracks usage in real-time via Solace events:

    fomokiller/usage/analysis/{userId}        # Track each analysis
    fomokiller/usage/limit-reached/{userId}   # Block when limit hit
    fomokiller/subscription/upgraded/{userId} # Unlock on payment

When users hit their limit:

1. Analysis request is **blocked** at the service level
2. User sees upgrade prompt with clear value proposition
3. Payment instantly unlocks continued access
4. Monthly usage resets automatically

### Revenue Psychology

1. **Public Dashboard** ‚Üí Creates FOMO ("What's manipulating MY interests?")
2. **Free Tier** ‚Üí Proves value with 3 analyses (enough to trust, not enough to depend on)
3. **Usage Limits** ‚Üí Fair, transparent pricing based on actual needs
4. **Detail Gating** ‚Üí Free users see the score, paid users see the evidence

### Key Differentiators

* **No feature degradation** - All tiers get same AI quality
* **Volume-based pricing** - Pay for how much you analyze, not what you analyze
* **Transparent limits** - Clear usage tracking visible in UI
* **Instant upgrades** - No waiting period, immediate access upon payment
